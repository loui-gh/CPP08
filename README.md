# CPP08
Introducing the STL! (Standard Template Library). Students are encouraged to use the Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth) and Algorithms templates as much as possible.

'Associated containers'
An associative container in C++ is a type of container in the Standard Template Library (STL) that stores elements in a sorted manner and allows for fast access, insertion and deletion of elements based on a key. The key can be used to index into the container to retrieve elements, instead of using a numerical index. Examples of associative containers in C++ are std::map, std::set, and std::unordered_map. These containers are implemented as balanced trees, hash tables, or other data structures that provide fast access to elements based on the key.
